<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Skully is a user driven compiler dedicated to producing high performance, compact and self-contained software in C#.</p>

## Performance
To gather this data, an executeable generated by each compiler is ran 100 times with a stopwatch to measure the time.
All executeables are compiled as their release/most optimized variant.

|Language|Code|Elapsed time(avg)|
|--|--|--|
| Skully | ```Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");``` | 565ms |
| Rust(rustc) | ```println!("Hello, World!");``` | 625ms |
| Cpp(gcc) | ```std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";``` | 642ms |

Sample size: 50 sets of 100 runs.
